Space Target is a hyper-casual Android game that will test your reaction time.

This repository contains some of the C# files used to build the game app.

After some time of the app being off the Google App Store it is currently under review awaiting approval to be published again.

The apk file is also available through the following link https://drive.google.com/file/d/139urzF0zJcMO3SIRYZLrfTTkrxFDdCl2/view?usp=sharing
